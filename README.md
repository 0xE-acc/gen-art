Generative Art

  This is a very simple generative art program written in Javascript and utilizing the 'svelte-npm' package which is basically just a wrapper for the HTML <Canvas> class. I would like to add functionality to the button so user can randomize colors or aspects of the art, possibly similar to NFT's.
  
To run:
  - 'clone or download repo'
  - 'cd' into directory
  - 'npm install'
  - 'npm run dev'
