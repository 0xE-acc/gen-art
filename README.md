# Generative Art

  This is a very simple generative art program written in Javascript and utilizing the 'svelte-npm' package which is basically just a wrapper for the HTML <Canvas> class. I would like to add functionality to the button so user can randomize colors or aspects of the art, possibly similar to NFT's. I would also like to use this as a very basic app example to practice deploying and configuring on the VeChain blockchain.
  
### To run:
  - `git clone https://github.com/ActionJackson86/gen-art`
  - `cd gen-art`
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
